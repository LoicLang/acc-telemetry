# ACC Telemetry Extractor (Console Edition)

Extract detailed telemetry data from Assetto Corsa Competizione gameplay videos using computer vision. Designed for **console players (PS5/Xbox)** who can't access native telemetry export.

## 🎯 What It Does

This tool analyzes ACC gameplay videos frame-by-frame to extract:
- **Throttle input** (0-100%)
- **Brake input** (0-100%)
- **Steering input** (-1.0 to +1.0)
- **Speed** (km/h via OCR)
- **Gear** (1-6 via OCR)
- **Lap numbers** (via template matching)
- **Track position** (0-100% via minimap analysis with Kalman filtering) 🆕

And generates:
- CSV data files for analysis
- **Interactive HTML visualizations** with zoom, pan, and hover tooltips
- **Position-based lap comparison** - see exactly where you gain/lose time 🆕
- High-resolution graphs with multiple detail levels
- Braking zone analysis
- Throttle application analysis
- Time-based lap comparison
- Lap statistics

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Place your gameplay video as input_video.mp4

# 3. Extract telemetry (generates interactive HTML + CSV)
python main.py

# 4. Generate detailed static analysis (optional)
python generate_detailed_analysis.py

# 5. Compare laps by time (optional - separate lap files)
python compare_laps.py lap1.csv lap2.csv

# 6. Compare laps by position (optional - single file with multiple laps)
python compare_laps_by_position.py data/output/telemetry_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

### Position-Based Lap Comparison (NEW! 🆕)
**Gold standard for racing analysis** - [See full guide](docs/POSITION_BASED_LAP_COMPARISON.md)

Compare laps by **track position** instead of time to see exactly where you gain or lose time around the track!

Features:
- 🎯 **Position alignment**: Compare inputs at the same corners (not same time)
- 📉 **Time delta plot**: Shows exactly where time is gained/lost
- 🔽 **Dropdown selector**: Switch between lap comparisons instantly
- 🗺️ **Track position axis**: 0% = start/finish, 50% = halfway around
- 📊 **5 synchronized plots**: Throttle, Brake, Steering, Speed, Time Delta

**Why it's better than time-based comparison:**
- See EXACTLY which corner is costing you time
- Compare braking points at the same position
- Identify problem sections immediately
- Direct comparison of driving technique

**Usage**:
```bash
python compare_laps_by_position.py data/output/telemetry_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

**Output**: `lap_comparison_position_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html` (open in browser)

### Detailed Static Analysis
The tool also generates **4 types of detailed static visualizations** (all at 300 DPI for printing/annotation):

### 1. Comprehensive Overview
6-panel layout with:
- Complete lap overview
- Throttle detail with reference lines
- Brake detail with statistics
- Steering detail (color-coded)
- Pedal overlay (shows when both pedals are pressed)
- Complete lap statistics

![Example Overview](docs/example_overview.png)

### 2. Zoomed Sections
Your lap divided into sections (default: 6) for detailed analysis of specific areas.

### 3. Braking Zones Analysis
Every braking event isolated with:
- Context before/after
- Duration, max brake, average brake
- Steering overlay to see trail braking

### 4. Throttle Application Analysis
3-panel analysis showing:
- Throttle with color gradient (rate of change)
- Throttle vs steering correlation
- Throttle application rate (smoothness)

## 🎮 Supported Setup

Currently configured for:
- **Game**: Assetto Corsa Competizione (Console)
- **Resolution**: 1280×720 (720p)
- **HUD**: Default ACC HUD with visible throttle/brake bars

**Other resolutions?** You'll need to recalibrate ROI coordinates using the helper scripts (see docs).

## 🔧 Calibration Helper Scripts

If your video resolution differs:
- `find_throttle_brake_bars.py` - Find ROI coordinates for your resolution
- `visualize_rois.py` - Verify ROI placement
- `debug_braking.py` - Debug brake detection issues

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Video Processing**: Extract frames from gameplay video
2. **ROI Extraction**: Crop specific regions (throttle bar, brake bar, steering indicator)
3. **Color Detection**: Use HSV color space to detect:
   - Green/yellow pixels (throttle - changes with TC activation)
   - Red/orange pixels (brake - changes with ABS activation)
   - White pixels (steering indicator dot)
4. **Measurement**: Calculate percentage of bar filled or position of indicator
5. **Export**: Generate CSV data and high-resolution visualizations

## 🎯 Use Cases

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Resolution-dependent**: ROI coordinates need recalibration for different video resolutions
2. **HUD-dependent**: Requires default ACC HUD to be visible
3. **Console-focused**: Designed for console gameplay footage (PC players have native telemetry export)
4. **Post-processing only**: Not real-time (but console players record first, analyze later anyway)

Built by a console sim racer frustrated by the lack of telemetry tools. Inspired by professional telemetry software like MoTeC i2 and RaceStudio, but adapted for the constraint of console gaming: **if you can see it on screen, we can extract it**.
